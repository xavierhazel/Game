      <h1>Exsploration of gaming and game design</h1>
     
      <h2>board game</h2>
        
      <p>though a project in the beginign ofthe3rd quarter of the school year, we exsplored hot and why people create board games by creating one of our own.
          the following are the rules of the game which where tested and reviewd before they where inproved.
        Start of play/ turn system
To start the game, each player chooses a dinosaur piece, they place this piece upon the established starting positions
Each round is composed of up to 4 turns on each turn the player can move 
Turn order is determined by players at the start of the game and must be consistent though the game

Game pieces:
2 6-sided dice
4 dinosaurs mini’s

To move during a turn: roll 2d6
If the lower number is odd, subtract the two values, and move that # of spaces clockwise.
If the lower number is even, add the two values, and move that # of spaces clockwise.
If both numbers are the same, you just lost your turn
If the two identical numbers are 1’s then they force the next player to forfeit their turn.
To move to the next level:
Must get to the counter-clockwise most descend (blocks that connect two layers)
Move in a clockwise direction

The goal: 
Be the first player to reach the core of the board

        
  If you end your turn on the same space as another player, both must roll a die 
The one with a higher number: Moves 1 space forward
The one with a lower number: Moves 1 space backwards
If roll the same number: Stay where you are

Dice must be rolled into a bowl 
If you roll two 6’s during your turn, you can swap with any other player 
You need to hit the exact number to win the game.

      <h2>2d coded game</h>
    <p>below are a few exsamples of sample code from the coding project titled as "coins deserv to be eayen.py"</p>
    
    <pre>
 <code>
    Fox=Actor("Samual-mander")
fox.pos = 100,100

coin = actor("New Piskel")
coin.pos = 200, 200
 </code>
 <samp>
    if game_over:
        screen.fill("pink")
        screen.daw.text("Final Score: " + str(score), topleft(10,10), fontsize =60)
 </samp>
 <kbd>
 if keyboard.left:
        fox.x=fox.x-4
    elif keyboard.right:
        fox.x = fox.x + 4
    elif keyboard.up:
        fox.y= fox.y - 4
    elif keyboard.down:
        fox.y = fox.y + 4
 </kbd>
    </pre>
    <p>
  1. the first piece of sample code is used to define the actors, actors are basically pieces on the board, if it was a chess game 
    they would be the individual pieces, they all need to be defined with an image and a certain
    set of location standards, but this first piece of code only contains there cosmetic standards.
  2. the second piece of code is used to determine the win condition of the game.in this game a salamander, defined as fox, 
    is tasked with collecting a fern. once this fern is
    collected the game is completed and the victory condition is achieved, the above code just executes this win condition.
   3. and the final piece of code is used to control how the player moves there "actor" this is the primary function of the
    game because without it it would
    just be an image with an unachievable victory condition. basically than the player presses a certain arrow key the 'fox' piece 
    moves in that direction without a corresponding movement to keyboard mapping software.
